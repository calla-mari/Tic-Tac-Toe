Description:

This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where players create an account then logs into to play the game.  Player one plays as X, alternating with player two, O.  The game will determine the winner and keeps track of total game played ans the current session's scores.

Technologies used:
Lots of googling

The process started with creating a log in authentication for the game, followed by creating a board using bootstrap.  After the gameboard is functioning properly, the game API is then linked to the board (unsuccessfully - referred to Unsolved issues below)

Unsolved issues:
- Can't patch/update game scoreBoard
- hiding different messages
- style
